Variational inference lies at the core of many state-of-the-art algorithms. To improve the approximation of the posterior beyond parameteric families it was proposed to include MCMC steps into the variational lower bound. In this work we explore this idea using steps of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, a very efficient MCMC method. In particular, we incorporated the acceptance step of the HMC algorithm and introduced some extensions to the algorithm geared towards faster convergence. Experimental results confirm the theoretical advantages of these modifications.
